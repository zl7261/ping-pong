BE Code Challenge
Imaging a simplified scenario where you are asked to implement 2 microservices called “ping” and “pong” respectively and integrates with each other as illustrated below – 
 
 
•	Both services must be implemented using Spring WebFlux and can be packaged & run as executable jar.
•	Both services are running locally in same device. The integration goes as simple as – Ping Service attempts to says “Hello” to Pong Service around every 1 secondand then Pong service should respond with “World”.
•	The Pong Service should be implemented with a Throttling Control limited with value 1, meaning that –  
•	For any given second, there is only 1 requests can be handled by it.
•	For those additional requests coming in the given second, Pong Service should return 429 status code.
•	Multiple Ping Services should be running as separate JVM Process with capability of Rate Limit Control across all processes with only 2 RPS (hint: consider using Java FileLock), meaning that -  
•	If all processes attempt to triggers Pong Service at the same time, only 2 requests are allowed to go out to Pong Service.
•	Among the 2 outgoing requests to Pong, if they reach Pong Service within the same second, one of them are expected to be throttled with 429 status code.
•	Each Ping service process must log the request attempt with result (*)  in separate logs per instance for review. The result includes: 
•	Request sent & Pong Respond.
•	Request not send as being “rate limited”.
•	Request send & Pong throttled it.
•	Increase the number of running Ping processes locally and review the logs for each.
 
BE Code Quality Acceptance Criteria:
•	Using Spring Boot and Spring Webflux Framework is a must.
•	Using Spring Spock Framework in Groovy for Unit Test.
•	Unit Test with Coverage >= 80%. (hint: Maven Jacoco Plugin should be used).
•	Completion of the Challenge should not take longer than 1 week.
